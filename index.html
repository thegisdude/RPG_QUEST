                                <strong>Physical:</strong> 4'5" tall with thick muscular build, dark auburn hair, salt-and-pepper beard, piercing blue eyes, and wry smile.

Resembles Wil Wheaton with the unmistakable visage of adventure etched into his middle-aged features.<br><br>
                                    
                                <strong>Background:</strong> Born into a family of renowned treasure hunters and ale connoisseurs, Nodrog was destined for a life of adventure. His father, Nodrog the Elder, was lost in a quest to conquer the dreaded dungeons of Zargon, leaving behind tales of valor and a legacy of unfinished business. Raised in the bustling underground city of Stonehold, where the clang of hammer on anvil was as common as tavern laughter, Nodrog learned the art of the blacksmith and the subtleties of diplomacy in crowded pubs and markets. His mother, a fierce warrior in her own right, taught him the importance of honor and the strength of family bonds. His lineage was one of craftsmen and heroes, raised on epic ballads of ancestral deeds.<br><br>
                                    
                                <strong>Personality:</strong> Nodrog is a cheerful, hearty soul who approaches life with a pint-sized optimism that belies his formidable combat skills. He's a lover of fine ales, tall tales, and a good laugh, often using humor to diffuse tense situations. His loyalty to his comrades is unshakeable, and he's not above risking his own hide for a friend in need. Beneath the jovial exterior lies a sharp mind and a fierce warrior's spirit - stubbornly resilient and never backing down from a challenge, especially when it involves defending his honor or the treasure he seeks. His love for ale is matched only by his love for battle, and he's been known to toast the memory of defeated foes with the very beverage they were too slow to claim. His optimism is as boundless as the caverns he explores, facing each new challenge with a grin and a mug held high.
